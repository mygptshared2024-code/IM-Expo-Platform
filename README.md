# IM-Expo Platform – Show Your Colors

**IM-Expo** is a web platform designed to empower talented individuals in Sri Lanka to showcase their work, connect with verified buyers, and participate in import/export activities. In Sri Lanka, access to international trade is often limited, with permissions usually restricted to government-approved individuals. IM-Expo aims to democratize this process, providing a user-friendly environment where talented creators can display their products, attract buyers, and even obtain necessary permissions for importing and exporting goods.

This platform is developed as a **final year HND project**, combining practical functionality with real-world challenges in trade, talent promotion, and e-commerce. It serves both creators with limited resources and experienced businesspersons, offering flexible subscription-based access and tools to manage product visibility, transactions, and verification.

## Key Features

### Talent Showcase

IM-Expo allows sellers to upload and publish their work, whether it’s handmade products, local crafts, organic produce, or artistic creations. Users can start with a free plan, which has a limited number of uploads, and upgrade via subscriptions to gain additional credits. Each credit represents the ability to publish one product, ensuring fair usage while supporting revenue generation for the platform.

### Verified Buyers and Sellers

The platform ensures that transactions occur safely by providing **verification status** for both buyers and sellers. Users with more than 10 successful transactions can become an **IM-Expo Verified Person**, gaining credibility and the ability to support other talented creators financially. Verified users can access advanced features, additional subscriptions, and expanded import/export privileges.

### Subscriptions and Credits

IM-Expo uses a subscription model to enable growth for both sellers and buyers. Sellers can choose between multiple plans based on their upload needs:

* **Basic Plan**: 1 free credit per subscription, allowing 1 product upload.
* **Advanced Plan**: Multiple credits for publishing 1–5 products at a time.

This credit system allows the platform to generate revenue while helping new sellers gain visibility. Buyers, on the other hand, can subscribe to enhance their profiles, increase visibility, and receive verification badges, fostering trust and encouraging engagement.

### Boost / Promotions Page

Sellers can further increase their product visibility by paying to boost their listings. Boosted products appear prominently on the homepage, product listings, and search results. Boost durations can be selected as 1 day, 7 days, or 30 days, with simple analytics such as views, clicks, and inquiries. Payment can be made via card, mobile, or subscription credits, and boosts are tracked as Active, Expired, or Upcoming.
